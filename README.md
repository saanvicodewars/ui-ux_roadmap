# UI/UX Beginner Roadmap with Tasks

## 1. Introduction to Design
### Key Topics:
- **What is UI/UX?**: Understanding the difference between User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX).
- **Basic Design Principles**: Contrast, alignment, proximity, repetition, balance.
- **Color Theory**: How colors influence user emotions and actions.
- **Typography**: The importance of font pairing and hierarchy.


### Tasks:
1. **Mini-Task**: Use a platform like Canva to design a simple poster using the design principles.
2. **Color Task**: Pick two apps/websites and analyze their color schemes. Why do you think the colors were chosen?
3. **Typography Task**: Explore Google Fonts, and pair two fonts for a fictional app homepage.

## 2. User-Centered Design

### Key Topics:
1. **Understanding Users**: Learn who your users are by creating **user personas** (simple profiles of your ideal users).
2. **User Journey Mapping**: Think about the steps a user takes when using a product, like an app.

### Tasks:
- **Persona Creation**: Make a profile for a grocery delivery app user. Include:
  - Who they are (age, job)
  - What they want (quick delivery, easy app)
  - What annoys them (slow delivery, confusing app)

- **Journey Mapping**: List the steps someone takes to **sign up** and **order** in the app (e.g., download app → make an account → choose groceries → place order → receive delivery).

- **Low-Fidelity Prototypes**: Simple clickable prototypes to test flows.

### Tasks:
1. **Wireframe Task**: Sketch a wireframe of a mobile app home screen (paper or digital).
2. **Low-Fidelity Prototype**: Use a tool like Figma or Adobe XD to create a simple clickable prototype for an app signup flow.

## 6. Interactive Prototyping
### Key Topics:
- **Interactive Elements**: Create transitions, hover states, and animations.
- **Microinteractions**: Small animations that give feedback to the user.

### Tasks:
1. **Prototype Task**: Add hover effects and transitions to your low-fidelity prototype using Figma or Adobe XD.
2. **Microinteraction Task**: Create a small animation (e.g., button hover or loading spinner) for an app.

## 7. Testing & Feedback
### Key Topics:
- **Usability Testing**: How to test your designs with real users.
- **A/B Testing**: Compare design variations to determine the best choice.

### Tasks:
1. **User Testing Task**: Share your prototype with friends and collect feedback on usability.
2. **A/B Testing Task**: Create two design variants for an app screen and gather feedback on which is preferred.

## 8. Portfolio Building
### Key Topics:
- **Case Studies**: Document your design process for each project.
- **Portfolio**: Create a personal portfolio showcasing your best work.

### Tasks:
1. **Case Study Task**: Write a case study for one of your design projects, explaining the problem, process, and result.
2. **Portfolio Task**: Build an online portfolio using platforms like Behance or Dribbble.
